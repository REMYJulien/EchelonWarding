					<p>First step you have to do to register new match is adding at least one player and one competition.
						In order to add competition you just have to write it name and click on save button </br>
						For player you have to fill his name and the name of his team.

				 <div class="ui raised  segment">
					 <p><i class="warning icon"></i> WARNING : You have to write carefully the name of competitions,
						 teams and players. As soon you save them in the database, you won't be able to modify them.
						 Also, input are case sensitive. This means 'Soaz' and 'SoAZ' won't be the same player in database. </br>
						 I would recommend to write all names in lower or upper case to avoid many problems.
						</p>
					</div>
				<h2 class="ui orange header">Create new match</h2>
				<div class="ui raised  segment">
					<p>To create new match you have to select the team you want to study, side where team is playing,
					it opponant, the competition and input a name for the game. Except game's name which is optionnal, all other parameters
				  must be fit.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ui raised  segment">
					<p>After submit form you will get a page where you can add some data. To add ward in database you have to
						click on the map. If everything goes ok, now you see a point and circle on the map. Next step
						is to write start timer,death timer,player who put it and type of the ward. You probably don't know
						when the ward will expire (ward can be destroy by opponant players), but it doesn't matter, you must
						entry timer or let the default timer (00:00). </br></br>If everything is ok, you can click on save button and
						you should see now a new entry in table below the map. As you can see you have two buttons in table. First
						one will delete the ward from database , second will allow you to confirm new death timer of the ward.
						To update death timer, you have to first click on cell of expiration timer and then click on save button.

						If you use an other format you will have majors issues in visualization section. </br> Also be carreful, if you don't click
						on save button after you enter new expiration timer for a ward , database won't be update.
